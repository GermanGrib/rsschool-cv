## Briefly About Myself:

 I worked at a federal company for 7 years at **<https://globaldrive.ru/>**. In the beginning, I was a salesperson and by the end, I had 7 stores under my control with around 55 personnel. After that, I chose to change my location and **decided to become a Front-End developer** because I can see the results of my work immediately and, most importantly, my location won't affect my ability to do my job. All I need is an **internet** connection. After gaining some experience as a developer, I want to have a big team and together we can do interesting and new things in the industry or explore new territories with our company.
