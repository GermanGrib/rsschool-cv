My name is German, I'm 29 years old, and I am currently living in Turkey. Since September 2022, I have started to learn web development, specifically frontend. In six months, I have completed a course at SkillBox, and in my opinion, it gave me pretty good knowledge of HTML and CSS. Fortunately, right after that, I came across the Front-end Stage 0 course at the **RS School**. During this course, I solidified my knowledge in HTML and CSS and finally discovered the magic of JS. I won't complain about how painful it was to "start talking" on JS without any prior knowledge of programming in general - those who know will understand.

After the successful completion of Stage 0, I got a job as a part-time front-end developer. I was able to combine work and study.

So far, I am halfway through the Stage 1 Front End **RS School** program and I have been working as a Junior Front End developer for two months.

When I finish the St 1 course, I will learn either React or Angular. I haven't decided yet. I am interested in developing and implementing what is in my head on browser pages. I like to observe and come up with what would be useful for people - it can be a new social network or a web page for advertising or promoting a business - who knows what ideas will pop up in my head.

I hope the available knowledge will be enough to implement my ideas.

I find it fulfilling to collaborate in a team and learn from the diverse problem-solving approaches of my teammates. I am highly adaptable and can readily adjust to changes in projects or the prevailing circumstances. I am driven to achieve desired outcomes using various strategies, as it is an inherent part of my work ethic. I believe in addressing unresolved questions openly, even if it may be uncomfortable for others, and I strive to make impartial decisions that satisfy all parties involved.

Thank you all for your attention, I am glad to meet you. Please find attached all my contact details under this video, whether you are students, mentors, employers, designers, clients, or random passers-by - you can always contact me, and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
